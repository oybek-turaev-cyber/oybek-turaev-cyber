Currently, I’m advancing my expertise through specialized Master’s courses in:  
- Android Security (App Exploitation & Reverse Engineering)  
- Software-Defined Networking (SDN)  
- Malware Analysis (Static & Dynamic Techniques)  

Alongside my studies, I maintain **personal GitHub Repositories** documenting my notes, investigation results, and a custom SOC playbook. These projects reflect my **hands-on experience in SOC operations, Threat Hunting, and Incident Response**, including:  
- 175+ Hack The Box Academy challenges completed (Pre-SOC & SOC certification) → [HTB Academy Challenges](https://shorturl.at/iyIPF)
