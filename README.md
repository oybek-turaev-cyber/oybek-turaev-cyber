# Oybek Turaev – Cybersecurity & Software Engineering Portfolio  

## About Me  

I’m Oybek, a **Cybersecurity Master’s Student** in the prestigious **Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s program in Cybersecurity (CYBERUS)**, with a **Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering**. I hold professional certifications including **CompTIA CySA+**, **Security+**, and recently completed the **Hack The Box Certified Defensive Security Analyst (CDSA) Exam** (results pending), where I investigated two real-world incidents during a 7-day assessment and produced a commercial-grade incident report.  

Currently, I’m advancing my expertise through specialized Master’s courses in:  
- Android Security (App Exploitation & Reverse Engineering)  
- Software-Defined Networking (SDN)  
- Malware Analysis (Static & Dynamic Techniques)  

Alongside my studies, I maintain **personal GitHub repositories** documenting my notes, investigation results, and a custom SOC playbook. These projects reflect my **hands-on experience in SOC operations, Threat Hunting, and Incident Response**, including:  
- 175+ Hack The Box Academy challenges completed (Pre-SOC & SOC certification) → [HTB Academy](https://shorturl.at/iyIPF)  
- 18+ Hack The Box machines pwned (Tier 0–2, ongoing) → [HTB Machines](https://shorturl.at/X7tjD)  
- 5 Advanced Splunk BOTS APT hunts → [Splunk BOTS](https://shorturl.at/oVKgi)  
- 4 HTB Sherlocks (ongoing) → [HTB Sherlocks](https://shorturl.at/ds2V3)  
- Bash scripting challenges → [Bash Practice](https://shorturl.at/0zGtU)  
- Active participation in **CTF competitions** (CYBERUS Spring School 2025, HTB Holmes CTF 2025)  

## Key Skills & Expertise  

- **SOC Operations & SIEM:** Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, ELK Stack  
- **Threat Hunting & IR:** Log forensics (Sysmon, Event Logs), network forensics (Wireshark, Suricata), MITRE ATT&CK detections  
- **Detection Engineering:** YARA (malware signatures), Sigma (log-to-SIEM rules)  
- **Security Testing:** Vulnerability assessments, penetration testing principles (Nessus, Nmap)  
- **Security Automation:** Python, Bash, PowerShell scripting for investigation and compliance  
- **Cloud Security:** Azure AD, IAM concepts  
- **Programming & Algorithms:** C/C++ (350+ problems on UVA Online Judge), Java (LeetCode), Python, Bash  
- **Certifications:** Hack The Box CDSA (in review), CompTIA CySA+, CompTIA Security+  

## Experience Highlights  

- **Cybersecurity Teaching Assistant (Amazon Program):** Supported Amazon employees in Linux security, threat detection, and IR.  
- **SOC Research Intern, University of Southern Brittany:** Conducted SOC-related research and detection engineering.  
- **Cybersecurity Research, CYBERUS Winter School (TalTech & NATO CCDCOE):** Focused on threat intelligence and SOC operations.  
- **Cyber Security Analyst Intern (Verzeo):** Penetration testing, threat assessments, vulnerability mitigation.  
- **Quality Assurance Analyst (Eurosoft):** Implemented security guidelines (OWASP, MASVS) and developed unit tests.  
- **Cybersecurity Program Leader:** Designed and led a cybersecurity training program, securing funding.  

## Featured Projects
